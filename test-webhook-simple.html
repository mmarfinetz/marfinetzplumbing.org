    <h1>Simple n8n Webhook Test</h1>
    <p>Since CORS is blocking direct requests, here are alternative ways to test your webhook:</p>
    
    <h2>Option 1: Test from your main website</h2>
    <p>The lead capture form on your main site is already configured to work with the webhook. Test it there by opening the contact form.</p>
    
    <h2>Option 2: Use curl from terminal</h2>
    <pre style="background: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px; overflow-x: auto;">
curl -X POST https://mitchmarfinetz.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/plumbing-lead \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Customer",
    "phone": "555-123-4567",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "property_type": "residential",
    "location": "123 Test Street, Erie, PA",
    "urgency": "this_week",
    "problem": "Test submission to verify webhook",
    "preferred_contact": "phone",
    "submitted_at": "'$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")'",
    "lead_source": "test_curl",
    "page_url": "terminal_test"
  }'
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Option 3: Test via n8n webhook settings</h2>
    <p>Go to your n8n workflow and test the webhook directly from the webhook node's test interface.</p>
    
    <h2>Option 4: Upload to your server</h2>
    <p>The CORS and CSP issues occur because you're opening the file locally. If you upload this to your web server at mmwcontracting.org, the webhook should work properly.</p>
