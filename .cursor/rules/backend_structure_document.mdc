# MMW Contracting Website - Backend Structure

## Overview
The MMW Contracting website currently operates primarily as a client-side application with minimal backend requirements. This document outlines the current backend structure and provides guidelines for future backend development.

## Current Backend Structure

### Static Site Hosting
- Hosted on GitHub Pages 
- Configured via GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/static.yml`
- Custom domain configured via CNAME file

### Next.js Static Export
- The Next.js application (calculator) is built as a static export
- Configuration in `next.config.js`
- Output to the `out` directory
- Deployed alongside static HTML files

### Form Handling
- Contact form integration with Google Forms
- No server-side processing currently required

### Google Reviews Integration
- External API integration for displaying Google Reviews
- API keys stored in `.env.local`
- JavaScript-based fetching and rendering

## Planned Backend Enhancements

### API Integration
- Create API endpoints for calculator data persistence
- Implement server-side validation for forms
- Develop endpoints for quote generation and storage

### Data Storage
- Implement database for storing quotes and user interactions
- Options to consider:
  - Firebase Firestore (serverless)
  - MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)
  - PostgreSQL (traditional relational database)

### Authentication
- Add user authentication for internal tools
- Role-based access control for admin features
- Secure storage of user credentials

### Analytics
- Server-side tracking of user interactions
- Performance monitoring
- Usage statistics for business intelligence

## Backend Technology Recommendations

### Serverless Functions
- Utilize Vercel or Netlify serverless functions
- Reduces infrastructure management
- Scales automatically with traffic

### Backend Framework Options
- Next.js API Routes (integrated with existing Next.js app)
- Express.js (Node.js framework)
- FastAPI (Python framework)

### Deployment Options
- GitHub Pages (current, static only)
- Vercel (Next.js optimized, includes serverless)
- Netlify (similar to Vercel)
- Traditional VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS EC2)

## Security Considerations

### API Security
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
- Implement proper backup procedures
- Follow data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)

### Environment Variables
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Rotate API keys regularly

## Backend Development Guidelines

### API Design
- Follow RESTful principles
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper error handling and status codes
- Document all endpoints

### Testing
- Implement unit tests for backend functions
- Create integration tests for API endpoints
- Set up automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Logging
- Implement structured logging
- Log important events and errors
- Set up monitoring and alerting

### Performance
- Optimize database queries
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Monitor response times and optimize as needed
