# Lead Tracking API Status

## ✅ API is Live and Working!

The lead tracking API is successfully deployed and running at:
**https://mmwcontractingorg-production.up.railway.app**

## Configuration Updates Made

1. **Lead Tracker** (`js/lead-tracker.js`)
   - Updated to use Railway URL: `https://mmwcontractingorg-production.up.railway.app`
   - Falls back to this URL by default unless overridden

2. **Test Files**
   - `test-lead-tracking.html` - Updated with Railway URL
   - `test-lead-tracking-enhanced.html` - Updated with Railway URL and pre-filled

3. **Form Handler** (`js/lead-capture.js`)
   - Still uses n8n webhook: `https://mitchmarfinetz.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/plumbing-lead`
   - This is separate from the tracking API and working as intended

## API Endpoints Verified

✅ **Health Check**
```
GET https://mmwcontractingorg-production.up.railway.app/
Response: {"status":"healthy","service":"Lead Tracking API","version":"1.0.0"}
```

✅ **Tracking Endpoint**
```
POST https://mmwcontractingorg-production.up.railway.app/track
Response: {"success":true,"leadScore":28,"message":"Lead data tracked successfully"}
```

## Testing Your System

1. Open `test-lead-tracking-enhanced.html` in your browser
2. The API should show as "Healthy" immediately
3. Run through all test scenarios:
   - Behavior simulations
   - Integration tests
   - Load testing

## CORS Configuration

The API is configured to accept requests from:
- `https://marfinetzplumbing.org` (production)
- You may need to add `http://localhost:*` for local testing

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Frontend Changes**
   - Commit and push the updated `js/lead-tracker.js`
   - This will enable tracking on your live site

2. **Monitor Performance**
   - Use the test suite to check API response times
   - Monitor Railway logs for any errors

3. **Configure Alerts** (Optional)
   - Set up environment variables in Railway for email/SMS alerts
   - Configure MongoDB for data persistence

The lead tracking system is now fully functional and ready for production use!
